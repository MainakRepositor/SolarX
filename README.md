# Omdena solar radiation app
Web application developed using Streamlit and Heroku to predict solar radiations.



This project is the final assignment of the Omdena **MLOps for AI Engineers and Data scientist** courses.

For this final project, I developed an application to predict solar radiations in Boulogne-Billancourt (greater Paris).

The data used for the model was extracted from [Solcast](https://solcast.com/). It contains solar and weather data from 2019 -  2021.

To deploy my web application, I used Streamlit and Heroku.
The web application is accessible through this [link](https://solar-radiation-heroku.herokuapp.com/).
